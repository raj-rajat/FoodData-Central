# Dietary Fiber Analysis in Food Products

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the dietary fiber content in various food products to identify high-fiber foods, understand nutritional trends, and make informed dietary choices. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to predict high fiber content.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to simplify the process of finding high-fiber foods, which can be beneficial for people looking to enhance their dietary fiber intake due to its health benefits, including improved digestion and reduced risk of chronic diseases.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the US Department of Agriculture and contains detailed nutritional information on over 1.8 million food products sold in the US.

## Features of the Dataset
The dataset includes various nutritional information such as:
- Fiber content
- Protein levels
- Total fats
- Sugars
- Calories

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python: Main programming language
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
- Scikit-Learn: Machine learning and data preprocessing

## Key Findings
- Identification of food categories with the highest fiber content.
- Trends in fiber content across different food products over time.
- Correlations between fiber content and other nutritional metrics like sugars and fats.

## Model Performance
The RandomForest model used to predict high fiber content achieved an accuracy of approximately 89.36%. The model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and feature importance analysis.
